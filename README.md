# Usage

The method of analysis of hierarchies is a systematic procedure for hierarchical
presentation of elements that determine the essence of any problem. Method
consists in decomposition into increasingly simple component parts and further
processing of the sequence of judgments of a person who makes a decision, according to
paired comparison. This approach to solving the problem of choice comes from
the natural ability of people to think logically and creatively, to determine events and
establish relations between them. To conduct reasonable
numerical comparisons should not compare more than 7Â±2 elements.

Let's begin by inputting the criteria and then proceed to compare each criterion with every other based on the tables provided.
