# Usage

The method of analysis of hierarchies is a systematic procedure for hierarchical
presentation of elements that determine the essence of any problem. Method
consists in decomposition into increasingly simple component parts and further
processing of the sequence of judgments of a person who makes a decision, according to
paired comparison. This approach to solving the problem of choice comes from
the natural ability of people to think logically and creatively, to determine events and
establish relations between them. To conduct reasonable
numerical comparisons should not compare more than 7Â±2 elements.

Let's begin by inputting the criteria and then proceed to compare each criterion with every other based on the tables provided.

In this instance, we will be engaging in the comparative analysis of airplanes.

</p>

Following the establishment of criteria, the subsequent step involves inputting options for comparison.

</p>

Now we should input data about all of the options based on every criterion. This data will serve as the basis for the comparative analysis.

</p>

Now we can examine the results of the analysis, which will provide insights into the comparison of the options based on the established criteria.
